# Datadog Agent for Render

Datadog helps you capture application traces and metrics that can help you improve the performance for your app.

You can set up a single Datadog agent to capture data for any number of services in your Render account.

This example deploys Datadog's [Docker agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/docker/) as a [private service](https://render.com/docs/private-services) on Render.

Once deployed, you can start sending [APM/Distributed Tracing](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/) and [DogStatsD](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/dogstatsd/?tab=hostagent) metrics to your private service URL.

The URL will look like `datadog-agent-lkyz` with APM available on TCP port `8126` and DogStatsD on UDP port `8125`.
